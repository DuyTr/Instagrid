# Instagrid

### Description:
A one-page, responsive website that allows a user to search for a hashtag via the Instagram API. This website uses Ajax to fetch data from an Instagram API endpoint and populate photos to the grid.

### Stuff used to make this:

 * HTML/CSS
 * JQuery
 * Getting JSON data using Ajax request from Instagram API
 * SASS
 * Gulp Automation Task
 * Responsive web design
 * Flexbox
 * ES2015 Redo

##### My thought on the project :+1: :

This was a very challenging project. It was my first hands-on project using SASS, Gulp, Flexbox and working with API. I'm really proud of working my way through Flexbox, SASS and working with JSON data by myself.

My biggest accomplishment was dealing with pagination JSON data in Instagram API. I later redo the project using the new ES2015.
